About:
------
libxmpp is a multi-threaded xmpp client/component library

Build:
------
git clone git://github.com/abhinavsingh/libxmpp.git
cd libxmpp/
make

Dependencies:
-------------
-levent -lexpat -pthread

How it works:
--------------
- a new xmpp stream is initialized by calling: xmpp_ctx * xmpp_start_new_stream(const char *jid, const char *pass);
- for xmpp clients jid = "user@domain.tld", pass = "user account password"
- for xmpp components jid = "component.domain.tld", pass = "component secret"
- xmpp_init_new_stream(...) in turn create 3 threads each by calling:
	- xmpp_stream * xmpp_stream_new()
	- xmpp_socket * xmpp_socket_new()
	- xml_stream * xml_stream_new()
- xmpp_socket do necessary SRV lookup and establish tcp socket to destination jabber host:port
- xmpp_socket will pipe all received xml data to underlying xml_stream thread
- xml_stream thread is an expat streaming parser
- xml_stream will pipe all parsed xml events to underlying xmpp_stream thread
- xmpp_stream thread is modeled as a finite-state-machine and implements various stages of an xmpp client and components
- finally, xmpp_stream thread will pipe matching events to the user thread

Provisions for sending signals and commands to a running xmpp stream via an interactive shell console
